This AGV is a programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research.The core technology is SLAM, Navigation and Manipulation. The agv uses  SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithms to build a map and can drive around the area. Also, it can be controlled remotely from a laptop, joypad or Android-based smart phone. Also it can be used as a mobile manipulator capable of manipulating an object by attaching a manipulator like OpenMANIPULATOR.
