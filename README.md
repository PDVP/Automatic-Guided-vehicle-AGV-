# Automatic Guided vehicle-AGV
An AGV system, or automated guided vehicle system, otherwise known as an automatic guided vehicle, autonomous guided vehicle or even automatic guided cart, is a system which follows a predestined path around a facility automatically without any human intervention .

This AGV is a programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research.The core technology is SLAM, Navigation and Manipulation. The agv uses  SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithms to build a map and can drive around the area. Also, it can be controlled remotely from a laptop, joypad or Android-based smart phone. Also it can be used as a mobile manipulator capable of manipulating an object by attaching a manipulator like OpenMANIPULATOR. 

#Project Stauts:_
-	Studied the kinematic and dynamic model of an automatic guided vehicle
-	Designed the AGV using PTC Creo
-	AGV model is simulated in the Robot operating system (ROS) – gazebo environment
-	Fabricated and Teleoperated the AGV with the keyboard and joystick 
-	Tested the algorithm to control the AGV’s pose and velocity using a linear PID controller
 Future prospects:
•	Integration of sensors like cameras, lidars, and rangefinders for precise pose estimation of the AGV
•	Implementation of SLAM and other AI techniques to navigate autonomously in an indoor environment
