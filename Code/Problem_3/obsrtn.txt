Right motor- M2
1. m+  +
   m-  - backward
   need to change the polarity for my code.


2. for speed nd direction check
	For standard mode, dirpin = 0 meaning backward direction
	low= 0 high speed =225 for pwm value
3. for cpr check
	The direction if the wheel is in forward direction from reference  the encoder values are negative( so need the change the Funct inteerupt fuction along with the polarity
	Cpr= 33300 theortical manual observation at low speed, 
	Encoderis working correctly for pwm vaue less than 100
