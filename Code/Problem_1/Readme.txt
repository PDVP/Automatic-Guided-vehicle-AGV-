Problem 1 :::
Need to control motor direction and speed with driver..

Frame length -set the PPM frame length in microseconds (1ms = 1000Âµs)
PULSE_LENGTH -set the pulse length in microseconds (The PPM signal pulse width must range from 600us to 2.4ms. The motor speed will be zero at PPM pulse width of 1.51ms)

Problem 2 :::
Need to control 2 motors direction and speed with driver...

Problem 3 :::
Repeat problem 2 with python.
